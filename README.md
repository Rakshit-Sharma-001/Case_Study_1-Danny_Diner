# Danny-Diner_Case-study-1
Hi Guys, This is my Github Repository.
This repository contains all of my code submissions for the #8WeekSQLChallenge!

All case study's requirements and resources are available on the challenge [website](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/).
Check out the sql file to find solutions along with the output images for better understanding.
Any suggestions and ideas for code improvemnt and optimisation are welcome.
I will be doing all of my SQL work in MySQL Workbench. Make sure to stay updated about the language and workbench you will be using because after gaining some general experience of using SQL Server and now, MYSQL Workbench, I can surely tell one thing that every workplace has its own style for coding, so directly copy-pasting code will not work everytime. It will be better to use documentation along with writing queires to get maximum contrl over that workplace and SQL language.
