# Danny-Diner_Case-study-1
This repository contains all of my code submissions for Part-1 of the #8WeekSQLChallenge!

All case study's requirements and resources are available on the challenge [website](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/).

Check out the Diner Schema for creation of database along with tables and insertion of data. 

SQL Code file contains solutions for all questions. Output images shall be uploaded in upcoming time for better understanding.

All of the SQL work has been written in MySQL Workbench. 

Also, I have done some changes to the Dataset. As you can see in code file, i have created 1 more entity in members table {member C having join date '2021-01-11'}.

And I have made product_id and customer_id keys in sales table as foreign keys to menu table and members table respectively to easily join these tables in several cases.
Any suggestions and ideas for code improvemnt and optimisation are welcome.
