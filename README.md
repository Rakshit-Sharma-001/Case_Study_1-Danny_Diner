# Danny-Diner_Case-study-1
Hi 
This repository contains all of my code submissions for the #8WeekSQLChallenge!

All case study's requirements and resources are available on the challenge [website](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/).
Check out the sql file to find solutions along with the output images for better understanding.
Any suggestions and ideas for code improvemnt and optimisation are welcome.
I will be doing all of my SQL work in MySQL Workbench. Make sure to stay updated about the language and workbench you will be using because direct copy-pasting code will not work everytime. It will be better to use documentation to get best results.
Also, I have done some changes to the Dataset. As you can see in code file, i have created 1 more entity in members table {member C having join date '2021-01-11'}
And I have made product_id and customer_id keys in sales table as foreign keys to menu table and members table respectively.
